To get this to run, you'll need:
- Processing (not the 2.0 beta, 1.5.1 works great)
- A couple of libraries: geomerative and controlp5 (the others that it needs are included in the code folder)

You'll also need to unzip the data file (VAST2011_MC1.sqlite.zip) to the same directory it's currently in. That's an sqlite database of the microblogging messages with the dates formatted as dates.
